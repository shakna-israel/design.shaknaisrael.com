    <h3>Client & Project</h3>
    <p>Ballarat Christian College is a P-12 school specialising in Christian Education.</p>
    <p>The website prior to the 30th Anniversary had been in place, without any major modification since 2005. Though the centered design had worked, it was due to be replaced later in the year by a new website.</p>
    <p>To bear them over and increase the publicity of the 30th Anniversary, the website was restyled.</p>
